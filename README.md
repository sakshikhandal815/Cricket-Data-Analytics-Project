# Cricket-Data-Analytics-Project
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing T20 cricket match and player data using web scraping, Python, Pandas, and Power BI to build a data-driven Best Playing XI. The goal is to objectively evaluate player performance and support team selection using statistical insights instead of subjective judgment.

🎯 Objectives
Collect real-world T20 cricket data from online sources
Clean, preprocess, and transform raw data for analysis
Define role-based performance metrics for players
Analyze player performance across batting and bowling parameters
Build interactive dashboards to support best XI selection

🛠️ Tech Stack
Web Scraping: Python (BeautifulSoup / Requests)
Data Processing: Python, Pandas, NumPy
Data Storage: CSV / JSON files
Visualization: Power BI
Analytics: DAX measures & calculated columns

📂 Project Workflow
Data Collection:
Scraped T20 match and player data from web sources using Python.
Data Cleaning & Transformation:
Processed raw JSON/CSV files using Pandas to handle missing values, standardize formats, and create analytical datasets.
Feature Engineering:
Created performance metrics such as strike rate, batting average, bowling economy, boundary percentage, dot ball percentage, and bowling strike rate.
Player Role Classification:
Categorized players into roles:
Openers
Anchors / Middle Order
Finishers
All-Rounders
Specialist Fast Bowlers
Dashboard Development:
Designed interactive Power BI dashboards with filters and KPIs to compare players and select the best playing XI.

📊 Key Insights:
Identified top-performing players based on role-specific criteria
